I'm an experienced data scientist specializing in machine learning and signal
processing.

I have tackled data-intensive problems across diverse domains, including
cardiology (deep-learning based ECG analysis), computational biology
(directional statistics for protein structure analysis), transportation
(time-series processing) and quantitative finance (learning-based portfolio
construction and optimization).

I completed my PhD in the Technion Computer Science Faculty, where I conducted
multidisciplinary research developing ML-based algorithms and statistical tools
for real-world applications in medicine and biology under the supervision of
Prof. [Alex Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il). My research has been
published in journals and conferences such as Nature Communications, PNAS, ICLR,
and ICML. I was also the head TA of the faculty's Deep Learning course.

In addition to research, I have a strong background in software engineering from
multiple technical roles, where I gained extensive experience creating robust,
testable, well-designed software.
