Currently a machine learning engineer and data scientist at
[Sibylla](https://sibylla.ai), a fintech startup, where I lead the design and
implementation of our machine-learning-based algorithmic trading platform.

Prior to this role, I completed my PhD in the Technion [Computer Science
Faculty](https://cs.technion.ac.il), advised by Prof. [Alex
Bronstein](https://bron.cs.technion.ac.il).  I conducted multidisciplinary
research focusing on machine learning and statistical tools, with applications
in medicine and biology.  Some research highlights include: Non-linear and
scalable extension for vector quantile regression, a powerful tool allowing
general statistical inference by modelling conditional quantiles; Distributional
analysis and hypothesis testing for codon-specific protein backbone angles;
computationally identifying protein structures defying the “one sequence, one
structure” principle; Deep-learning based ECG analysis system focused on
clinical applicability and statistical performance. During that time I was also
head TA of the CS faculty's [Deep
Learning](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236781/semesters/w22/) course
(2019-2022).  I also hold an MSc in Biomedical Engineering and a BSc in
Electrical Engineering, both from the Technion. 

In addition to my research pursuits, I have a strong technical background in
software engineering. Before starting my PhD I worked in multiple technical
roles. I have extensive experience writing robust, testable, well-designed
code, leading software teams and architecting large-scale systems.
