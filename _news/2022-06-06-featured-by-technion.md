**Featured**: Our [recent work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30390-9) about the
association between protein structure and synonymous genetic coding was featured
on the Technion website! See [english](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/2022/06/protein-folding-cs/) and [hebrew](https://www.technion.ac.il/2022/06/%D7%94%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%96%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%A8/).
