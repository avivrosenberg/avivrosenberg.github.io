**New paper in PNAS**: 
Our [new paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2301064120) in the domain of
computational structural biology was recently published in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.  We performed distributional analysis of protein
backbone angles using a novel a cross-peptide-bond Ramachandran plot that captures the
conformational preferences of the amino acid pairs, and demonstrate that it
conveys biologically meaningful information, not apparent in the traditional
Ramachandran plot.
