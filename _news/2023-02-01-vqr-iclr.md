**New paper in ICLR**:
Our [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UxqUgchwXkK),
"Fast Nonlinear Vector Quantile Regression" has been published
in the International Conference for Learning Representations (ICLR 2023).
In this work, we extend Vector Quantile Regression to support non-linear
specification, while ensuring monotonicity and scaling to millions of samples.
