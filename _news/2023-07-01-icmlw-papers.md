**New workshop papers in ICML**: 
Two of our new papers have been accepted to the ICML 2023 workshop [Frontiers4LCD](https://frontiers4lcd.github.io/).
In the [first paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QHvrI74Zir) we propose a novel approach for estimating high-dimensional conditional quantile functions on manifolds.
In the [second paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=DUZbGAXcyL) we propose a novel continuous formulation of vector quantile regression that allows for accurate, scalable, differentiable, and invertible estimation of nonlinear conditional vector quantile functions.
